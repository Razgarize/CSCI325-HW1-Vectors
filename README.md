Brief: Takes any sort of numbers and stores them. Mimics the std::vector library.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">The program features a mimicked version of the std::vector library where you can resize the vector.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Designed an interface that will allow the user to either make a massive test, or play with the features available to the user.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">The main test will go through a series of operations and outputs to test the library.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">During testing, the operations and output performed as expected.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Once the main test is complete, you must relaunch the program. Otherwise, it is ok to run the program as is.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">On major caviat is that the major test must be ran first before playing with other parts ofthe interface. Otherwise, it will not be available to the user.</li>
</ul>
